Hello Unity Devs!
I'm in the process of creating an awesome new Audio Asset for you on the theme of Angels and Demons.
It will include a dozen fully interactive/adaptive soundtracks and a few awesome random music generators for Church! (baroque organs, choirs,...)

All tracks are in MP3 format, 192kb/s quality.

In the meantime, you can already enjoy this free pack which includes extracts from all of the pieces included inside my upcoming asset! 
Hope you'll enjoy them as much as I enjoyed composing them!
Let me know what you think!

Cheers!
Marma
